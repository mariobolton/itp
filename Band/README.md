# Band Website
## [Website](eann116.github.io)
## Documentation
Everything went pretty smoothly in terms of creativty and coordination for the band content. Also we thought that the content process of creating the index.html was smooth until we got into the css file. We had lots of problems with the css file because it wasn't changing anyhting from the look of the website. We tried several things and thoguht that the problem was on this file. But after trying many things, and using several other templates, we found out that the problem was in the html file. There were some dividers that were messing with the connection between the style and the index, and also there were some organization issues like placing headers inside paragraphs that we had to fix. After this, everything was working, but we didn't had much time to change stuff from the style. 

## Self-assesment
I helped the group with the creativity process, specially for the band image. Then I helped with the creation of the index.html file. I also was in charge of creating the style.css file and delivering it to Ean so that it can be all together with the rest of the files. 

## Group-assesment
I think we worked great as a group, each one of us contributed with our own ideas specially for the band. For the creation of the website Ean killed it hosting the website and being in charge of the index.html file. Roah helped us a lot with writing the paragraphs, the name of the band and editing the photo. I think it was a great division of roles and made it really comfortable to work in the project.
