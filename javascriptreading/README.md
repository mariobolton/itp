#javaScript Reading

##Chapter 1: Values, Types and Operators
####One thing I knew
I knew that computers work only with data, which is stored as long sequences of bits. This is mentioned during the introduction to the chapter, before the "Values" subtitle.

####One thing I didn't know
I didn't know anything about javaScript honestly, only that it is a programming language. But to be specific, I didn't know what operators were, as well as what/how they are used. Strings was a completely new concept too. 

##Chapter 2: Program Structure
####One thing I knew
I knew about the `console.log` function and what to use it for. Nevertheless, having the specific definition as, a function that writes that writs its arguments to some text output, is really useful.

####One thing I didn't know
Something that I didn't know and I find really really useful is the `else` keyword. I didn't know this was the way to make the program handle when the condition is not true, and even create an alternate execution path. Also, I found really useful the fact that you can chain multiple `if` or `else`, when we have more than two paths to choose from.

##Chapter 3: Functions
####One thing I knew
I think the only thing I knew in this chapter was that functions help us to define new vocabulary. So that we can be more flexible with the vocabulary that we are going to be programmin with.

####One thing I didn't know
I didn't know that bindings that are declared inside a function are going to be local to that function. I find really useful to have this type of isolation between functions.
