### Overview
The main focus of my final project will be the use of javaScript for doing VJing and designing visuals. Wether I'm going to use them for my performances on the future, or for any other purpose. For the delivery of this, I thought it would be great to deliver them as inside of my personal portfolio website (so in that way I also stop using linktree).

#### This project won't overlap with any work doing outside of this class.

### Good Outcome:
I will accomplish no matter what a good visual that can be used with P5LIVE for VJing in a music performance.

### Better Outcome:
I think I can accomplish a good set of visuals, that can be engaging and used for VJing in a music performance AND deliver them in a personal portfolio website.

### Best Outcome: 
I hope to accomplish a good set of visuals, that can be engaging and used for VJing in a music performance, but not delivered in an entire personal portfolio website.

### Steps:
1. Decide figures that I'm going to use and have them ready with their respective code in p5.js. (Nov 12)
2. Make them audioreactive in p5.js and start to get familiar with P5LIVE (Nov 19)
3. Start working on the website and deliver the structure. (Nov 26)
4. Incorporate p5.js visuals on the website and work on the website's aesthetic. (Dec 3)
5. Final tweakings and corrections so that everything looks and sounds great! (Dec 9)
