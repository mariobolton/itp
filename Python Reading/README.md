# Python Reading Homework - Mario Bolton
## Chapter 1
### 1 thing I did know
I knew the differences between different type of languages, specifically the ones compared in the chapter, formal and natural. Nevertheless is really helpful how it is explained to understand the differences for programming. 
### 1 thing I didn't know
I didn't know that there was a program inside Pyhton called the Pyhton Interpreter, that it's role is to read and execute the pyhton code.

## Chapter 3
### 1 thing I did know
I knew that inside a programming language we can use functions and arguments to do function calls, as we learned it from programming withn javaScrpit. This was basically the same for pyhton, which it could count as something I didn't know, but well I did know how to use them previously. 
### 1 thing I didn't know
I didn't know that there were modules in python and what they were. Neither that we have to import them to be used, or that there was one that provided mathematical functions, I'm curious of what other modules there are.
## Chapter 5
### 1 thing I did know
I did know a lot from this chapter! (luckily). But specially I knwe about boolean expressions, chained and nested conditionals (specially from fizzBuzz), recursion and that infinite recursion wasn't a good idea (from the fizzBuzz own experience with crushing the program).
### 1 thing I didn't know
I didn't know something about the first part of this chapter, floor divisions. I didn't know that in pyhton there was one operator that could divide two numbers and round down to an integer, I don't remember if there was one in javaScript but I find it really helpful. 
## Chapter 10
### 1 thing I did know
I did know what lists were and how to use them from our SQL chapter earlier this semester. But know that I read everything that you can do with them in python I see that we were just scratching the sufrace of them. Basically I knew that they were composed of objects and indicies, also that they are mutable. 
### 1 thing I didn't know
I didn't know that we could use a for loop to traverse the list, or I don't remember it from SQL. Also I didn't know that there are operators that work in a certain way specifically for lists, such as the slice or the common operators like '+' or '*'. In general, I didn't know all of the different things we could do with lists in python, that make it so much powerful than what we did in SQL.
