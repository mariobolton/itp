# Haiku - Homework Documentation
## Finding Haiku
First of all, I had to look for a Haiku for the assignment. So I went to [Poetry Foundation](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/), and search for some Haikus there. Finally I found one called [The bottoms of my shoes](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/146979/the-bottoms-of-my-shoes) that I liked and decided to use for the assignment.
### Recording Haiku
Then, I went to the terminal so that I can use the CLI to say and record the Haiku. I first copied the Haiku directly from the site and figured out that the format wasn't working for the CLI. So I wrote it down myself. Then, when trying to name the file, I used a title with spaces, so the file was named only with the first word and the rest was spoken by the CLI. So I had to use another title, now without spaces, and finally ended up with the code that worked:
`say The bottoms of my shoes, are clean. From walking in the rain -o Thebottomsofmyshoes.aiff`
